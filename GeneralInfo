This is the general info for my OWB extension which'll just be adding projects as I get the time (slowly learning HOI4/EU4 as I want to make an EU4 overhaul for my worldbuilding project).

NEW FORMBLE COUNTRIES





ADLER ARMS
Adler Arms originally started as a FO4 project that got scrapped, I wanted to introduce an immersive and semi-lore friendly faction that'd sell guns, attachments, and schematics (a la Gun Runners).

Moi being moi things couldn't help but dovetail out of hand and I ended up with a ton of ideas/notes and wanting to get into HOI/EU4 modding decided I'd try my hand at polishing it up and making an OWB submod.

Possible Leaders
Adler - Starting Leader, Ruler, 
  Gun Runner Legacy: Bonus to Firearm Production/Research (balancing will be a lot of testing as I'm new to modding
