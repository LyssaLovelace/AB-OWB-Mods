Adler Arms originally started as a FO4 project that got scrapped, I wanted to introduce an immersive and semi-lore friendly faction that'd sell guns, attachments, and schematics (a la Gun Runners). 

Moi being moi things couldn't help but dovetail out of hand and I ended up with a ton of ideas/notes and wanting to get into HOI/EU4 modding decided I'd try my hand at polishing it up and making an OWB submod.
